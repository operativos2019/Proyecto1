to run the whole benchmark you can just run the command line:
    bash ./installBenchmarkTool.sh

*this temporaly will create a csv file for each test inside the benchmark tool

if you only want to install the bclient you just need to run the script like this:
    bash ./installBenchmarkTool.sh

And then you can run the command line with bclient following the next structure:
    bclient <machine> <port> <file> <N-threads> <N-cycles>

Example: bclient localhost 8001 html_basic_document.html 5 5
